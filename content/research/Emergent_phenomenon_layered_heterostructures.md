Assembling layered heterostructures consisting of graphene and its insulating isomorph, hexagonal-Boron Nitride, allows us to study emergent phenomenon in strongly interacting, reduced dimensional systems. Examples include exciton condensation and Coulomb drag in closely-spaced parallel quantum wells; fractional quantum Hall effect in a system of Dirac electrons with non-zero Berry phase; spontaneousy symmetry breaking and magnetic ordering in a multicomponent 2DEG with full control over the inherent degrees of freedom; and the evolution of non-Abelian quasiparticles in a system with tunable orbital wavefunctions.

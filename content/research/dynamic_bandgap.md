An intriguiging feature of bilayer graphene is the ability to induce a bandgap by application of transverse electric field, where the gap grows larger with increasing displacement fied. In the transition metal dichalcogenides it is predicted that it may be possible under similar conditions to close the gap. From a device perspective, the capability to dynamically tune the electronic bandgap represents a significant technological advantage over conventional materials providing the opportunity for a new generation semiconductor devices. We explore applications to opto-electronics, tunable sensors, and novel transistors where the ability to dynamically tune electron transport characteristics in-situ offers unprecedented device functionality.
